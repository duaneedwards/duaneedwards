### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Duane, I am an Australian Senior Software Engineer living in Brisbane, Australia.  

By day I work for HealthTrack Medical Systems, working mainly with HL7 systems and other backend integrations. 

Maintainer of the [nHapi](https://github.com/nHapiNET/nHapi) open source HL7 project, oversaw bringing it to GitHub from sourceforge and through numerous releases to it's current 500k+ downloads.
